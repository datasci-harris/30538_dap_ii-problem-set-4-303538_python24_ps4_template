**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 

## Style Points (10 pts)

## Submission Steps (10 pts)

## Download and explore the Provider of Services (POS) file (10 pts)

import packages
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import altair as alt
import os

alt.renderers.enable("png")

```

1. 
```{python}
raw_health = r"C:/Users/andre/Documents/GitHub/problem-set-4-andrew-justine"
path_health16 = os.path.join(raw_health, "pos2016.csv")
health16 = pd.read_csv(path_health16) 

path_health17 = os.path.join(raw_health, "pos2017.csv")
health17 = pd.read_csv(path_health17)

path_health18 = os.path.join(raw_health, "pos2018.csv")
health18 = pd.read_csv(path_health18, encoding = "ISO-8859-1")

path_health19 = os.path.join(raw_health, "pos2019.csv")
health19 = pd.read_csv(path_health19, encoding = "ISO-8859-1")
```

Attribution: I asked ChatGPT how to solve the unicode errors I 
was encountering, and I was advised to try out different
encodings, including "ISO-8859-1".

Q1 Answer:
```{python}
variables_list = health16.columns

print("These are the variables I selected: ", variables_list)
```


2. 
Function for subsetting the datasets to short term hospitals
```{python}
def short_term(X):
  Y = X[(X["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"] == 1) & (X["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"] == 1)]
  return(Y)

```

Run function on health16
```{python}
short16 = short_term(health16)

print("There are ", len(short16), " hospitals in this dataset")
```

    a.
    b.
3. 

short term function on health17
```{python}
short17 = short_term(health17)

```

short term function on health18
```{python}
short18 = short_term(health18)

```

```{python}
short19 = short_term(health19)

```

Appending the data together
```{python}
# add a "year" column to each dataset, for future disagg
def add_column(X, the_year):
  year_col = []
  i = 0
  while i < len(X):
    year_col.append(the_year)
    i += 1
  X["Year"] = year_col
  return(X)

#run on each dataframe
add_column(short16, 2016)

add_column(short17, 2017)

add_column(short18, 2018)

add_column(short19, 2019)
```

Attribution: I asked my code why my len(X) and length of index
values were not equal, and was advised to set i equal to 0 
instead of 1. 

Concat the dataframes together
```{python}

concat_1 = pd.concat([short16, short17], axis = 0)

concat_2 = pd.concat([concat_1, short18], axis = 0)

df_health = pd.concat([concat_2, short19], axis = 0)

df_health.reset_index(drop = True)
```

Code 
```{python}
def  one_dummy(C):
  observation = []
  i = 0
  while 1 > 0 and i < C:
    observation.append(1)
    i += 1
  return(observation)

#add observation column to df
df_health["Observation"] = one_dummy(len(df_health))


```
