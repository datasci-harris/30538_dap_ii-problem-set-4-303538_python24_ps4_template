**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 

## Style Points (10 pts)

## Submission Steps (10 pts)

## Download and explore the Provider of Services (POS) file (10 pts)

(Note: Used ChatGPT to troubleshoot why pd.read_csv wasn't working- learned to specify a different encoding other than utf-8)


1. Which variables do we need to complete the exercise:
- Short-term hospitals
  -Certification Date (CRTFCTN_DT)
  -Change of ownership date (CHOW_DT)
  -Provider code 1 (PRVDR_CTGRY_CD)
  -subtype 1 (PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD)
  -CMS Certification number (PRVDR_NUM)
  -Termination Code (PGM_TRMNTN_CD)
  -Facility Name (FAC_NAME)
  -Facility Zip (ZIP_CD)

2. 
    a. Import the pos2016.csv file and subset it:
```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('pos_2016.csv', encoding='Windows-1252', low_memory=False)

df.columns = ["prvdr_subtype_code", "prvdr_category_code", "change_of_owner_date", "certification_date", "facility_name", "prvdr_num", "termination_code", "zip_code"]

df.head(5)

df = df[(df["prvdr_category_code"] == 1) & (df["prvdr_subtype_code"] == 1)]

```
After subsetting to only short-term hospitals with these codes, we find 7245 hospitals in our data set. The provided KFF article cites a number of "nearly 5000".

This discrepancy could be due to potential duplicates in our data (if a hospital was acquired or merged into a newer hospital, it may be counted twice). Additionally, our data may include hospitals that are short-term hospitals, but not specifically acute-care hospitals providing emergency care/surgery and other interventions, which the KFF article might exclude.
